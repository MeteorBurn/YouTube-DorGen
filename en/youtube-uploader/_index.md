**YouTube-Uploader** is a ZennoPoster template for automated, multi-threaded video uploads to YouTube, designed for webmasters, SEO specialists and operators of “grey” content seeking free traffic.

YouTube-Uploader enables bulk uploading of videos in any format or length to multiple channels at once, automatically populating metadata, thumbnails, descriptions, keywords, hashtags and more. This tool is aimed at professionals who need fast, efficient management of video uploads optimized for specific keywords and topics.

**Key features of YouTube-Uploader:**

-  **Multi-threaded uploads**, including #shorts, with automatic filling of descriptions, keywords, thumbnails, end screens, cards, comments and likes.

-  **Advanced video settings management**: category, audience, restrictions, scheduled publishing.

-  **Multi-channel support on a single account**, including branded channels and connected managers.

-  **Custom macros and text templates** for randomizing and adapting metadata to platform algorithms during upload.

-  **Automated two-factor authentication (2FA)** for high-authority channels, not just brand-new or inactive ones.

**Unique advantage**\
At its core, YouTube-Uploader uses direct HTTP requests to YouTube--no API integration required and no reliance on heavyweight browser-based tools like Selenium, Puppeteer, Dolphin, etc. These HTTP requests not only accelerate the upload process but also reduce system load, freeing up resources for other tasks to run concurrently, ensuring both convenience and stability.

**Why it’s convenient:**

-  **No API expertise required** or complex automation software: everything works “out of the box”--simply configure your settings and upload.

-  **Full transparency and detailed logging**: see every action in real time and adjust parameters on the fly.

-  **Ideal for advanced workflows**: niche testing, large-scale SEO optimization, and integration into arbitrage and conditional-free traffic schemes.

**Who benefits:**

-  **Webmasters** managing dozens of YouTube channels.

-  **SEO specialists** uploading content for targeted topics and keyword searches.

-  **Traffic operators** testing vertical #shorts and niche formats.
